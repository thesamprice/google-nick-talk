v1
We used "matchesName" to match uses of the name, and prepended namespace:: .

Todo:
 * matchesName added qualifiers where they weren't needed. Should we detect
   whether we're inside the namespace?
 * puts qualifiers in the wrong places a lot of the time, for example
   "namespace::enum Colour"
 * failed to qualify uses of types, eg. "Colour func();"
 * failed to look through DeclRefExpr's referring to decls with matching names
